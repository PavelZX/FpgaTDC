This FPGA project measures time delay with high precision.
One chip pin emits test impulse, and second chip pin captures echo after delay. Delay is measured with precision about 200 picoseconds.
Project uses PLL phase shift during multiple measure attempts.
Method can be used in TDC, Time-to-digital conversion.
